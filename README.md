# abercombieandfitchassessment

Exercise-1:
- Queried  https://5dc588200bbd050014fb8ae1.mockapi.io/assessment for a list of users and used ES6 fetch call and renderUsers() displayed the data in an unordered list.
- Successfully displayed the data in the browser and resolved type and async-await issues.
- The main flaw is that some of the get requests to request the url of the user's avatar are not working.
- Another drawback is that due to time constraints in trying to resolve module export issues, I could not write mock function tests in Jest to test the application.


Exercise-2:
 -I reorganized the code to separate concerns from code to HTML rendered in the browser.
- I attempted to center the application to the requirements, however it is still not centered relative to 375px.
- Due to time constraints, I could not do certain things such as change the scope of some variables to local so that it is not part of the cache.
